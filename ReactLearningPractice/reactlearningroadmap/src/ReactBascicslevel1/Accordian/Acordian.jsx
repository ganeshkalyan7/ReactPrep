IITMRP also connects its startups with established companies, who, while not taking the same high risks as the startups, are willing to help, partner, and even acquire the successful startups. Examples include Tata's investment in Tejas Networks and HCL's investment in GUVI. This has helped scale the products emerging from Indian R&D efforts.",
